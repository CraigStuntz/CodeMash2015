### Abstract
With the introduction of Google's Android Wear, you are no longer restricted to just phones and tablets when it comes to developing great Android apps. You want notifications on your wrist? You got it. You want to run an app on your wrist? You got it. In this session, let me take you through the awesome new features of Android Wear and the tools required to start building the apps you want for Wear. We'll extend a current app with rich notifications and even create a brand new app from scratch live on stage that runs right on your Android Wear device. All demonstrations will be coded in C#, but will be applicable to any Android developer in any language.
