# From Backbone to Ember and Back(bone) Again
> by Jonathan Knapp from [Coffee and Code](http://coffeeandcode.com)

As a software consultant, I get to see a lot of interesting code. In this
particular instance a client was in the process of transforming their web
application to a rich, interactive interface with the help of another company.

The project kicked off using Backbone and things were great. Until they were
not great. Pages starting getting more and more involved and blame started
being thrown at the technology choice.

A move to Ember.js ensued and the app was rewritten. But architecturally bad
decisions don't hide long, and soon the rewrite was preforming even worse.
That's when I stepped in, with the help of another consultant, to solve the
performance issues once and for all. Our solution used Backbone.js and it
was fast. This is that journey.
